                    <p class="large">House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner on Thursday warned Senate Democrats against making big changes to a House-passed government funding measure, or Republicans may strip the flexibility it gives for applying military spending cuts.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Republican-controlled House on Wednesday passed a stop-gap bill to keep government agencies and programs, including defense, funded through September 30, largely with Democratic support. The Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to vote on similar legislation next week.</p>
                    
                    <p>The House bill adds some flexibility for the Pentagon that helps it deal with its $46 billion share of $85 billion in automatic, across-the-board spending cuts for the remainder of this fiscal year that ends on September 30.</p>

                            <span class="credit">Reuters / Tom Cavanaugh</span>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Senate Democrats have complained the House bill gave no such flexibility to domestic programs and have said they would remedy that in their bill.</p>
                    
                    <p>They have also criticized the House bill for making no effort to replace the across-the-board cuts under the so-called "sequester" that were imposed after the White House and Congress failed to agree to an alternative plan to reduce deficits.</p>
                    
                    <p>New funding legislation, called a "continuing resolution," to keep money flowing to agencies is needed by March 27 to avoid a broad government shutdown.</p>
                    
                    <p>"If Senate Democrats try to load up this bill with extraneous provisions and partisan riders, we will be prepared to move a clean continuing resolution through the end of the year," Boehner told a news conference.</p>
                    
                    <p>"I don't want to do that, I don't think that would help our troops, so I would urge Democrat leaders in the Senate to not get greedy and get carried away and try to put forward the possibility of a government shutdown."</p>
                    
                    <p>Boehner also said he would continue to demand at least $1 of spending cuts for every dollar of debt limit increase when the borrowing cap must next be raised, likely during the summer.</p>
                    
                    <p>Both the House and Senate are expected to unveil dueling budget plans that reflect deeply divided Republican and Democratic priorities in taming the $16.7 trillion federal debt.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Stalled Efforts</h3>
                    
                    <p>Until he final days before Friday, when the reductions began because of a law enacted in 2011, constituents urged lawmakers to avert them.</p>
                    
                    <p>The cuts threaten the U.S. economic recovery, could disrupt federal services from airports to national parks, and may force furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and employees of federal contractors, the administration says.</p>
                    
                    <p>"They want to kill us all," Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said of his constituents.</p>
                    
                    <p>Laura Zayner, a senior officer with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, was among 400 federal workers facing possible furloughs who came to Washington last week to lobby Congress.</p>
                    
                    <p>"We consider the furlough a slap in the face. We take it personally," Zayner said. "We are not picking sides, Democrats or Republicans. But we want them to do their jobs and stop the cuts."</p>
                    
                    <p>John Kelshaw, who works with the Internal Revenue Service, came to town from New Jersey. He and a few other federal workers met with Republican Representative John Runyan.</p>
                    
                    <p>"We told him that a lot of our people live paycheck to paycheck. We said, 'Give us a break,'" Kelshaw said. He said Runyan, of New Jersey, listened but made no commitments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Both sides seem to size up any issue on a basis of who gets the political advantage, he said. "If someone suddenly came up with a cure to cancer, the question in Washington would be, 'Is this good or bad for Obama?'"</p>
                    
                    <p>The president on Friday said of the cuts, "This is not a win for anybody. This is a loss for the American people."</p>
                    
                    <p>Hatch, of Utah, said he recently told his state legislature that he expected the federal government to impose the sweeping cuts. "A number of them stood up and said maybe that's the only way we are going get any real reduction in spending," he said.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the other side, Representative Luis Gutierrez, a Chicago Democrat who won an 11th term last year with more than 80 percent of the vote, said his constituents "tell me 'Keep on fighting, Luis, keep on fighting.'"</p>
                    
                    <p>Representative Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican whose district includes the shipbuilding yards in Newport News that are likely to be hit hard by cuts in military spending, was dismayed by the untargeted reductions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Rigell got a letter from a constituent last month that read in part, "My husband, a project manager for the defense industry, went to work this morning to lay off half of his workforce because of sequestration."</p>
                    
                    <p>In an interview, Rigell said, "When I think they (shipyard workers) could lose their jobs because of the dysfunction in Washington … this is not acceptable to me."</p>
                    
                    <p>"I've been at that shipyard. Some of hardest working folks I know. They're coming in at 5:30 a.m. with a lunch bucket and making $35,000 a year and wondering if they'll have a job."</p>

                            <p>The best part of this discourse is citizens are actually paying attention to their govt. instead of 
    allowing these hacks in DC to do whatever they want. Thank you America for starting to get involved with your own govt.. There is now hope the country will not implode or become Greece. The sequester will create some pain, but nothing compared to a collapse or BK.</p>
